Generic Quotation System

A client-facing system that allows for complex products to specified by a purspective customer. Quotes can be submitted and stored for later analysis by staff and customers alike.

The system UI is underpinned by Sementic UI / JQuery & JQuery UI

It uses a PHP backend, and some of the UI bleeds in via PHP echo statements (not optimal)

It's expected that Vue.js will be used for the client-side state management MVVM
